PS Scripts
==========
**Powershell scripts for different usecases made by me for me.**

# watch   

similar to linux's watch command. Prints out commands every specified interval.

# ani-cli

just a powershell wrapper for ani-cli.

# history  

A comprehensive powershell history keeping utility. Automatically rotates the history to numbered files if the log count reaches 1000.

# vmrun   
 
Enhanced vmrun command to be able to use names rather than vmx paths. 

# ssh-session 

Saves and deletes ssh-session. When sessions are saved, local machine's public key is written in remote machine's "authorized_keys" file. A variable is created which is stored in a vars file and which is loaded for current powershell session. When sessions are deleted, both the public key on the remote server and the variable is deleted.
